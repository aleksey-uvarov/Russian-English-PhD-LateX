abstract = {We introduce the problem of shadow tomography: given an unknown quantum mixed state ρ of dimension D, as well as known two-outcome measurements E1, . . . , EM , estimate the probability that Ei accepts ρ, to within additive error ε, for each of the M measurements. How many copies of ρ are needed to achieve this, with high probability? Surprisingly, we give a procedure that solves the problem by measuring only O ε−5 · log4 M · log D copies. This means, for example, that we can learn the behavior of an arbitrary n-qubit state, on all accepting/rejecting circuits of some fixed polynomial size, by measuring only nO(1) copies of the state. This resolves an open problem of the author, which arose from his work on private-key quantum money schemes, but which also has applications to quantum copy-protected software, quantum advice, and quantum one-way communication. Recently, building on this work, Brandão et al. have given a different approach to shadow tomography using semidefinite programming, which achieves a savings in computation time.},

abstract = {Predicting properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a classical shadow, can be used to predict many different properties: order \$\textbackslash log M\$ measurements suffice to accurately predict \$M\$ different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size, and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables, and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

abstract = {The classical shadows protocol, recently introduced by Huang, Keung, and Preskill [Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], is a hybrid quantum-classical protocol that is used to predict target functions of an unknown quantum state. Unlike full quantum state tomography, the protocol requires only a few quantum measurements to make many predictions with a high success probability, and is therefore more amenable to implementation on near-term quantum hardware. In this paper, we study the effects of noise on the classical shadows protocol. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the quantum circuits involved in the protocol are subject to various known noise channels and derive an analytical upper bound for the sample complexity in terms of a generalized shadow norm for both local and global noise. Additionally, by modifying the classical post-processing step of the noiseless protocol, we define an estimator that remains unbiased in the presence of noise. As applications, we show that our results can be used to prove rigorous sample complexity upper bounds in the cases of depolarizing noise and amplitude damping.},

Quantum computers promise to unlock these applications, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will likely not be available for several years. Currently available quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited qubit numbers and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational Quantum Algorithms ({VQAs}), which employ a classical optimizer to train a parametrized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. {VQAs} have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisioned for quantum computers, and they appear to the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain including the trainability, accuracy, and efficiency of {VQAs}. In this review article we present an overview of the field of {VQAs}. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to overcome their challenges as well as the exciting prospects for using them as a means to obtain quantum advantage.},

While the experimental advancement towards realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e.~qubits that are not error-corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations in a limited coherence time. In the search for quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization. The goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of {NISQ} computational paradigms and algorithms. We discuss the key structure of these algorithms, their limitations, and advantages. We additionally provide a comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing {NISQ} devices.},

The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in {ML} and modern statistics such as the bias–variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including {MaxEnt} models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between {ML} and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern {ML}/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton–proton collisions).

	abstract = {The stochastic gradient descent ({SGD}) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say \$32\$-\$512\$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

In the small time-step limit, this is equivalent to the {McLachlan}'s variational principle. Our approach is efficient in the sense that it exhibits an optimal linear scaling with the total number of variational parameters. Furthermore, it is global in the sense that it uses the variational principle to optimize all parameters at once. The global nature of our approach then significantly extends the scope of existing efficient variational methods, that instead typically rely on the iterative optimization of a restricted subset of variational parameters. Through numerical experiments, we also show that our approach is particularly advantageous over existing global optimization algorithms based on the time-dependent variational principle that, due to a demanding quadratic scaling with parameter numbers, are unsuitable for large parameterized quantum circuits.},

              Generating and detecting genuine multipartite entanglement ({GME}) of sizeable quantum states prepared on physical devices is an important benchmark for highlighting the progress of near-term quantum computers. A common approach to certify {GME} is to prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ({GHZ}) state and measure a {GHZ} fidelity of at least 0.5. We measure the fidelities using multiple quantum coherences of {GHZ} states on 11 to 27 qubits prepared on the {IBM} Quantum

A fidelity of 0.546 ± 0.017 was recorded for a 27-qubit {GHZ} state when {QREM} was used, demonstrating {GME} across the full device with a confidence level of 98.6\%. We benchmarked the effect of parity verification on {GHZ} fidelity for two {GHZ} state preparation embeddings on the heavy-hexagon architecture. The results show that the effect of parity verification, while relatively modest, led to a detectable improvement of {GHZ} fidelity.},

              N
              systems, this limit requires that they be in a quantum-mechanically entangled state. We describe a scalable method of spectroscopy that can potentially take full advantage of entanglement to reach the Heisenberg limit and has the practical advantage that the spectroscopic information is transferred to states with optimal protection against readout noise. We demonstrate our method experimentally with three beryllium ions. The spectroscopic sensitivity attained is 1.45(2) times as high as that of a perfect experiment with three non-entangled particles.},

	abstract = {We prove that \$poly(t) {\textbackslash}cdot n{\textasciicircum}\{1/D\}\$-depth local random quantum circuits with two qudit nearest-neighbor gates on a \$D\$-dimensional lattice with n qudits are approximate \$t\$-designs in various measures. These include the "monomial" measure, meaning that the monomials of a random circuit from this family have expectation close to the value that would result from the Haar measure. Previously, the best bound was \$poly(t){\textbackslash}cdot n\$ due to Brandao-Harrow-Horodecki ({BHH}) for \$D=1\$. We also improve the "scrambling" and "decoupling" bounds for spatially local random circuits due to Brown and Fawzi. One consequence of our result is that assuming the polynomial hierarchy ({PH}) is infinite and that certain counting problems are \${\textbackslash}\#P\$-hard on average, sampling within total variation distance from these circuits is hard for classical computers. Previously, exact sampling from the outputs of even constant-depth quantum circuits was known to be hard for classical computers under the assumption that {PH} is infinite. However, to show the hardness of approximate sampling using this strategy requires that the quantum circuits have a property called "anti-concentration", meaning roughly that the output has near-maximal entropy. Unitary 2-designs have the desired anti-concentration property. Thus our result improves the required depth for this level of anti-concentration from linear depth to a sub-linear value, depending on the geometry of the interactions. This is relevant to a recent proposal by the Google Quantum {AI} group to perform such a sampling task with 49 qubits on a two-dimensional lattice and confirms their conjecture that \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt n)\$ depth suffices for anti-concentration. We also prove that anti-concentration is possible in depth O(log(n) loglog(n)) using a different model.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11897},
	abstract = {We study the hardness of learning unitary transformations by performing gradient descent on the time parameters of sequences of alternating operators. Such sequences are the basis for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and represent one of the simplest possible settings for investigating problems of controllability. In general, the loss function landscape of alternating operator sequences in \$U(d)\$ is highly non-convex, and standard gradient descent can fail to converge to the global minimum in such spaces. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that -- despite the highly non-convex nature of the control landscape -- when the alternating operator sequence contains \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$ or more parameters, gradient descent always converges to the target unitary. The rates of convergence provide evidence for a "computational phase transition." When the number of parameters is less than \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, gradient descent converges to a sub-optimal solution. When the number of parameters is greater than \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, gradient descent converges rapidly and exponentially to an optimal solution. At the computational critical point where the number of parameters in the alternating operator sequence equals \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, the rate of convergence is polynomial with a critical exponent of approximately 1.25.},

	abstract = {Gate model quantum computers with too many qubits to be simulated by available classical computers are about to arrive. We present a strategy for programming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means that the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the device. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by unitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational problems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a Hamiltonian. These problems may not ﬁt naturally on the physical layout of the qubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on the qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters. Measurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new parameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the energy). As an example we consider ﬁnding approximate solutions to {MaxCut} on 3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a rectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at least 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5). We open up the algorithm to have diﬀerent parameters for each single qubit X rotation and for each {ZZ} interaction associated with the nearest neighbor interactions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an enveloping classical algorithm can be used to ﬁnd the parameters which sit on the grid to optimize an objective function with a diﬀerent connectivity. We discuss strategies for ﬁnding good parameters but oﬀer no evidence yet that the proposed approach can beat the best classical algorithms. Ultimately the strength of this approach will be determined by running on actual hardware.},

While it has been shown that such a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic structure problems and idealized model Hamiltonians, the highly relevant problem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a prohibitive amount of resources. Here, we show that by using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum computer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms, the electronic structure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a quantum computer. In our approach, the quantum computer solves a small effective quantum impurity problem that is self-consistently determined via a feedback loop between the quantum and classical computation. Use of a quantum computer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known classical algorithm, and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to be resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical qubits becomes available.},

However, {VQE} approaches encounter various difficulties in simulating molecules of industrially relevant sizes, among which the choice of the ansatz for the molecular wavefunction plays a crucial role. In this work, we push forward the capabilities of adaptive variational algorithms ({ADAPT}-{VQE}) by demonstrating that the measurement overhead can be significantly reduced via adding multiple operators at each step while keeping the ansatz compact. Within the proposed approach, we simulate a set of molecules, O\$\_2\$, {CO}, and {CO}\$\_2\$, participating in the carbon monoxide oxidation processes using the statevector simulator and compare our findings with the results obtained using {VQE}-{UCCSD} and classical methods. Based on these results, we estimate the energy characteristics of the chemical reaction. Our results pave the way to the use of variational approaches for solving practically relevant chemical problems.},

	abstract = {In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) era, solving the electronic structure problem from chemistry is considered as the ‘killer application’ for near-term quantum devices. In spite of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy proﬁles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e.~a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is key to ﬁnding useful applications of these promising devices within the ﬁeld of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a {NISQ}-friendly method called ‘state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver’ which combines two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged {VQE}. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule {CH}2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin—a crucial step in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms fulﬁl the necessary condition to describe the molecule’s conical intersection, i.e.~the ability to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing.},

By engineering a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian enabled by the resonator-mediated interactions, the system of qubits initialized coherently evolves to an over-squeezed, non-Gaussian regime, where atomic Schr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}dinger cat states, i.e., superpositions of atomic coherent states including {GHZ} state, appear at specific time intervals in excellent agreement with theory. With high controllability, we are able to take snapshots of the dynamics by plotting quasidistribution \$Q\$-functions of the 20-qubit atomic cat states, and globally characterize the 18-qubit {GHZ} state which yields a fidelity of \$0.525{\textbackslash}pm0.005\$ confirming genuine eighteen-partite entanglement.

First we consider entanglement between two particles which is robust against disposals of other particles. To completely detect these kinds of entanglement, full knowledge of the multiparticle density matrix (or of all reduced density matrices) is required. Then we review the relation of the separability properties of l-partite splittings of a state ρ to its multipartite entanglement properties. We show that it sufﬁces to determine the diagonal matrix elements of ρ in a certain basis in order to detect multiparticle entanglement properties of ρ. We apply these observations to analyse two recent experiments, where multiparticle entangled states of 3 (4) particles were produced. Finally, we focus on bound entangled states (non-separable, nondistillable states) and show that they can be activated by joint actions of the parties. We also provide several examples which show the activation of bound entanglement with bound entanglement.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11240},
	shorttitle = {Quantum Neuron},
	abstract = {Even the most sophisticated artificial neural networks are built by aggregating substantially identical units called neurons. A neuron receives multiple signals, internally combines them, and applies a non-linear function to the resulting weighted sum. Several attempts to generalize neurons to the quantum regime have been proposed, but all proposals collided with the difficulty of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential for classical neurons, due to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we propose a solution to this roadblock in the form of a small quantum circuit that naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum circuit defines a building block, the "quantum neuron", that can reproduce a variety of classical neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process superpositions of inputs and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In the construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide numerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained with superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this training suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately. When arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit properties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian rule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted inputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional) neural network dynamics implies that the vast body of literature and results on neural networks becomes directly relevant in the context of quantum machine learning.},

This article presents a systematic approach to {QNN} research, which so far consists of a conglomeration of ideas and proposals. Concentrating on Hopﬁeld-type networks and the task of associative memory, it outlines the challenge of combining the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics of neural computing and the linear, unitary dynamics of quantum computing. It establishes requirements for a meaningful {QNN} and reviews existing literature against these requirements. It is found that none of the proposals for a potential {QNN} model fully exploits both the advantages of quantum physics and computing in neural networks. An outlook on possible ways forward is given, emphasizing the idea of Open Quantum Neural Networks based on dissipative quantum computing.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14619},
	abstract = {Recurrent neural networks are the foundation of many sequence-to-sequence models in machine learning, such as machine translation and speech synthesis. In contrast, applied quantum computing is in its infancy. Nevertheless there already exist quantum machine learning models such as variational quantum eigensolvers which have been used successfully e.g. in the context of energy minimization tasks. In this work we construct a quantum recurrent neural network ({QRNN}) with demonstrable performance on non-trivial tasks such as sequence learning and integer digit classification. The {QRNN} cell is built from parametrized quantum neurons, which, in conjunction with amplitude amplification, create a nonlinear activation of polynomials of its inputs and cell state, and allow the extraction of a probability distribution over predicted classes at each step. To study the model's performance, we provide an implementation in pytorch, which allows the relatively efficient optimization of parametrized quantum circuits with thousands of parameters. We establish a {QRNN} training setup by benchmarking optimization hyperparameters, and analyse suitable network topologies for simple memorisation and sequence prediction tasks from Elman's seminal paper (1990) on temporal structure learning. We then proceed to evaluate the {QRNN} on {MNIST} classification, both by feeding the {QRNN} each image pixel-by-pixel; and by utilising modern data augmentation as preprocessing step. Finally, we analyse to what extent the unitary nature of the network counteracts the vanishing gradient problem that plagues many existing quantum classifiers and classical {RNNs}.},

	abstract = {Quantum neural networks ({QNNs}) have generated excitement around the possibility of efficiently analyzing quantum data. But this excitement has been tempered by the existence of exponentially vanishing gradients, known as barren plateau landscapes, for many {QNN} architectures. Recently, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks ({QCNNs}) have been proposed, involving a sequence of convolutional and pooling layers that reduce the number of qubits while preserving information about relevant data features. In this work we rigorously analyze the gradient scaling for the parameters in the {QCNN} architecture. We find that the variance of the gradient vanishes no faster than polynomially, implying that {QCNNs} do not exhibit barren plateaus. This provides an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized {QCNNs}, which singles out {QCNNs} as being trainable unlike many other {QNN} architectures. To derive our results we introduce a novel graph-based method to analyze expectation values over Haar-distributed unitaries, which will likely be useful in other contexts. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results.},

	abstract = {With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises, formalises and extends the link by systematically rephrasing quantum models as a kernel method. It shows that most near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. In particular, kernel-based training is guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.},

We provide a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state and ground state energy of a Hamiltonian. The description of the Hamiltonian is assumed to be a linear combination of unitaries. Our algorithm is iterative and systematically constructs the Ansatz using any given choice of the initial state and the unitaries describing the Hamiltonian. In a particular iteration, the task of the quantum computer remains to measure two overlap matrices. Using recent results in literature, this task can be performed efficiently on current quantum hardware without requiring any complicated measurements such as the Hadamard test. At the end of a particular iteration, the classical computer solves a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The algorithm terminates if the desired stopping criterion has been achieved, otherwise proceeds to the next iteration. Our algorithm works for almost every random choice of the initial state and provides an approach to circumvent the barren plateau problem.},

	shorttitle = {{MoG}-{VQE}},
	abstract = {Variational quantum eigensolver ({VQE}) emerged as a first practical algorithm for near-term quantum computers. Its success largely relies on the chosen variational ansatz, corresponding to a quantum circuit that prepares an approximate ground state of a Hamiltonian. Typically, it either aims to achieve high representation accuracy (at the expense of circuit depth), or uses a shallow circuit sacrificing the convergence to the exact ground state energy. Here, we propose the approach which can combine both low depth and improved precision, capitalizing on a genetically-improved ansatz for hardware-efficient {VQE}. Our solution, the multiobjective genetic variational quantum eigensolver ({MoG}-{VQE}), relies on multiobjective Pareto optimization, where topology of the variational ansatz is optimized using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ({NSGA}-{II}). For each circuit topology, we optimize angles of single-qubit rotations using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy ({CMA}-{ES}) -- a derivative-free approach known to perform well for noisy black-box optimization. Our protocol allows preparing circuits that simultaneously offer high performance in terms of obtained energy precision and the number of two-qubit gates, thus trying to reach Pareto-optimal solutions. Tested for various molecules (H\$\_2\$, H\$\_4\$, H\$\_6\$, {BeH}\$\_2\$, {LiH}), we observe nearly ten-fold reduction in the two-qubit gate counts as compared to the standard hardware-efficient ansatz. For 12-qubit {LiH} Hamiltonian this allows reaching chemical precision already at 12 {CNOTs}. Consequently, the algorithm shall lead to significant growth of the ground state fidelity for near-term devices.},

	shorttitle = {Deep Variational Quantum Eigensolver},
	abstract = {We propose a divide-and-conquer method for the quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to solve larger problems with small-scale quantum computers. Specifically, we concatenate variational quantum eigensolver ({VQE}) with reducing the dimensions of the system, where the interactions between divided subsystems are taken as an effective Hamiltonian expanded by the reduced basis. Then the effective Hamiltonian is further solved by {VQE}, which we call \{{\textbackslash}it deep {VQE}\}. Deep {VQE} allows us to apply quantum-classical hybrid algorithms on small-scale quantum computers to large systems with strong intra-subsystem interactions and weak inter-subsystem interactions, or strongly correlated spin models on large regular lattices. As proof-of-principle numerical demonstrations, we use the proposed method for Heisenberg anti-ferromagnetic models, including one-dimensionally coupled 12-qubit Heisenberg anti-ferromagnetic models on Kagome lattices. The largest problem size of 48 qubits is solved by simulating 12-qubit quantum computers. The proposed scheme enables us to handle the problems of \${\textgreater}1000\$ qubits by concatenating {VQE} with a few tens of qubits. Deep {VQE} will provide us a promising pathway to solve practically important problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.},

In this work we investigate this issue in several systems of interest, including organic molecules, transition metal complexes, the uniform electron gas, Hubbard models, and quantum impurity models arising from embedding formalisms such as dynamical mean-field theory. Our approach uses a state-of-the-art classical technique for high-fidelity ground state approximation. We find that easy-to-prepare single Slater determinants such as the Hartree-Fock state often have surprisingly robust support on the ground state for many applications of interest. For the most difficult systems, single-determinant reference states may be insufficient, but low-complexity reference states may suffice. For this we introduce a method for preparation of multi-determinant states on quantum computers.},

We introduce new strategies to reduce the circuit depth for the implementation of {UCC} and improve the optimization of the wavefunction based on efficient classical approximations of the cluster amplitudes. Additionally, we propose an analytical method to compute the energy gradient that reduces the sampling cost for gradient estimation by several orders of magnitude compared to numerical gradients.

Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that indeed the unitary version of the coupled cluster ansatz can be reliably performed in physical quantum system, a trapped ion system. We perform a simulation on the electronic structure of a molecular ion ({HeH}\${\textasciicircum}+\$), where the ground-state energy surface curve is probed, energies of excited-states are studied and the bond-dissociation is simulated non-perturbatively. Our simulation takes advantages from quantum computation to overcome the intrinsic limitations in classical computation and our experimental results indicate that the method is promising for preparing molecular ground-states for quantum simulation.},

Among all proposed {VQE} algorithms, the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles excitations ({UCCSD}) {VQE} ansatz has achieved high accuracy and received a lot of research interest. However, the ﬁrst order Trotter {UCCSD} {VQE} has gate complexity up-bounded to O(n5) using Jordan-Wigner transformation, where n is the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian. The high complexity makes {UCCSD} difﬁcult to be implemented on near term quantum computer. Here we introduce a new {VQE} ansatz based on the particle preserving exchange gate to achieve excitations. The proposed improved {VQE} ansatz has gate complexity up-bounded to O(n4). Numerical results of simple molecular systems such as {BeH}2, H2O, N2, H4 and H6 using the proposed improved {VQE} ansatz gives very accurate results within chemical accuracy of about 10−3 Hartree.},

Various methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of noise on variational algorithms, including several that model the noise as damping expectation values of observables. In this work, we benchmark various methods, including two new methods proposed here, for estimating the damping factor and hence recovering the noise-free expectation values. We compare their performance in estimating the ground-state energies of several instances of the 1D mixed-field Ising model using the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm with up to 20 qubits on two of IBM's quantum computers. We find that several error-mitigation techniques allow us to recover energies to within 10\% of the true values for circuits containing up to about 25 ansatz layers, where each layer consists of CNOT gates between all neighboring qubits and Y-rotations on all qubits.},

It has been established that the onset of a barren plateau regime depends on the cost function, although the particular behavior has been demonstrated only for certain classes of cost functions. Here we derive a lower bound on the variance of the gradient, which depends mainly on the width of the circuit causal cone of each term in the Pauli decomposition of the cost function.

	abstract = {Quantum machine learning ({QML}) offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for programming near-term quantum computers, with applications in chemistry, metrology, materials science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains an ansatz, in the form of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task of interest. However, challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep ansatzes are difficult to train, due to flat training landscapes caused by randomness or by hardware noise. This motivates our work, where we present a variable structure approach to build ansatzes for {QML}. Our approach, called {VAns} (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially) remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization. Consequently, {VAns} is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ {VAns} in the variational quantum eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications and also in the quantum autoencoder for data compression, showing successful results in all cases.},

	abstract = {Invariant theory is concerned with functions that do not change under the action of a given group. Here we communicate an approach based on tensor networks to represent polynomial local unitary invariants of quantum states. This graphical approach provides an alternative to the polynomial equations that describe invariants, which often contain a large number of terms with coefficients raised to high powers. This approach also enables one to use known methods from tensor network theory (such as the matrix product state factorization) when studying polynomial invariants. As our main example, we consider invariants of matrix product states. We generate a family of tensor contractions resulting in a complete set of local unitary invariants that can be used to express the R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies. We find that the graphical approach to representing invariants can provide structural insight into the invariants being contracted, as well as an alternative, and sometimes much simpler, means to study polynomial invariants of quantum states. In addition, many tensor network methods, such as matrix product states, contain excellent tools that can be applied in the study of invariants.},

Hence our framework can handle generic tensor network states, including matrix product states. Our categorical model subsumes the traditional quantum circuit model while remaining directly and easily applicable to problems stated in the language of quantum information science. The circuit diagrams themselves now become morphisms in a category, making quantum circuits a special case of a much more general mathematical framework.

Even when ﬁnding individual satisfying solutions is computationally easy (e.g. 2-{SAT}, which is in P), determining the number of solutions can be \#P-hard. Recently, computational methods simulating quantum systems experienced advancements due to the development of tensor network algorithms and associated quantum physics-inspired techniques. By these methods, we give an algorithm using an axiomatic tensor contraction language for n-variable \#{SAT} instances with complexity O((g + cd)O(1)2c) where c is the number of {COPY}-tensors, g is the number of gates, and d is the maximal degree of any {COPY}-tensor. Thus, n-variable counting problems can be solved efﬁciently when their tensor network expression has at most O(log n) {COPY}-tensors and polynomial fan-out. This framework also admits an intuitive proof of a variant of the Tovey conjecture (the r,1-{SAT} instance of the Dubois–Tovey theorem). This study increases the theory, expressiveness and application of tensor based algorithmic tools and provides an alternative insight on these problems which have a long history in statistical physics and computer science.},

	abstract = {The fundamental problem faced in quantum chemistry is the calculation of molecular properties, which are of practical importance in fields ranging from materials science to biochemistry. Within chemical precision, the total energy of a molecule as well as most other properties, can be calculated by solving the Schrodinger equation. However, the computational resources required to obtain exact solutions on a conventional computer generally increase exponentially with the number of atoms involved. This renders such calculations intractable for all but the smallest of systems. Recently, an efficient algorithm has been proposed enabling a quantum computer to overcome this problem by achieving only a polynomial resource scaling with system size. Such a tool would therefore provide an extremely powerful tool for new science and technology. Here we present a photonic implementation for the smallest problem: obtaining the energies of H2, the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We perform a key algorithmic step - the iterative phase estimation algorithm - in full, achieving a high level of precision and robustness to error. We implement other algorithmic steps with assistance from a classical computer and explain how this non-scalable approach could be avoided. Finally, we provide new theoretical results which lay the foundations for the next generation of simulation experiments using quantum computers.

	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}) is considered to be one of the most promising approaches towards using near-term quantum computers for practical application. In its original form, the algorithm applies two diﬀerent Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a recent work [S. Lloyd, {arXiv}:1812.11075] argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbor {ZZ} terms, this set-up is quantum computationally universal, i.e., all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the present paper, we give the complete proof of this statement and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional {QAOA} might be considered universal. We further generalize this type of universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with {ZZ} and {ZZZ} terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.},

	abstract = {Application of the adiabatic model of quantum computation requires efficient encoding of the solution to computational problems into the lowest eigenstate of a Hamiltonian that supports universal adiabatic quantum computation. Experimental systems are typically limited to restricted forms of 2-body interactions. Therefore, universal adiabatic quantum computation requires a method for approximating quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary spectral error using at most 2-body interactions. Hamiltonian gadgets, introduced around a decade ago, offer the only current means to address this requirement. Although the applications of Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily grown since their introduction, little progress has been made in overcoming the limitations of the gadgets themselves. In this experimentally motivated theoretical study, we introduce several gadgets which require significantly more realistic control parameters than similar gadgets in the literature. We employ analytical techniques which result in a reduction of the resource scaling as a function of spectral error for the commonly used subdivision, 3- to 2-body and \$k\$-body gadgets. Accordingly, our improvements reduce the resource requirements of all proofs and experimental proposals making use of these common gadgets. Next, we numerically optimize these new gadgets to illustrate the tightness of our analytical bounds. Finally, we introduce a new gadget that simulates a \${YY}\$ interaction term using Hamiltonians containing only \${\textbackslash}\{X,Z,{XX},{ZZ}{\textbackslash}\}\$ terms. Apart from possible implications in a theoretical context, this work could also be useful for a first experimental implementation of these key building blocks by requiring less control precision without introducing extra ancillary qubits.},

This book aims to present the best contemporary practices in the use of tensor networks as a reasoning tool, placing quantum states, operators and processes on the same compositional footing. The book has 7 parts and over 40 subsections which took shape in over a decade of teaching. In addition to covering the foundations, the book covers important applications such as matrix product states, open quantum systems and entanglement \$-\$ all cast into the diagrammatic tensor network language. The intended audience includes those in quantum information science wishing to learn about tensor networks. It includes scientists who have employed tensor networks in their modeling codes who have interest in the tools graphical reasoning capacity. The audience further includes the graduate student researcher, whom with some effort, should find this book accessible. I would appreciate it if you emailed me about any mistakes or typos you find.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms dominate gate-based applications of modern quantum processors. The so called, \{{\textbackslash}it layer-wise trainability conjecture\} appears in various works throughout the variational quantum computing literature. The conjecture asserts that a quantum circuit can be trained piece-wise, e.g.{\textasciitilde}that a few layers can be trained in sequence to minimize an objective function. Here we prove this conjecture false. Counterexamples are found by considering objective functions that are exponentially close (in the number of qubits) to the identity matrix. In the finite setting, we found abrupt transitions in the ability of quantum circuits to be trained to minimize these objective functions. Specifically, we found that below a critical (target gate dependent) threshold, circuit training terminates close to the identity and remains near to the identity for subsequently added blocks trained piece-wise. A critical layer depth will abruptly train arbitrarily close to the target, thereby minimizing the objective function. These findings shed new light on the divide-and-conquer trainability of variational quantum circuits and apply to a wide collection of contemporary literature.},

Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits, prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts, in both the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory, which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07267},
	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms ({VQAs}) are proposed to solve relevant computational problems on near term quantum devices. Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers ({VQEs}) and quantum approximate optimization algorithms ({QAOAs}) that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea to use a classical computer to train a parameterized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are {NP}-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that for every polynomial time algorithm, there exists instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large, unless P = {NP}. Even for classically tractable systems, composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show that the optimization is {NP}-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima.

	abstract = {Since Shor’s discovery of an algorithm to factor numbers on a quantum computer in polynomial time, quantum computation has become a subject of immense interest. Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers — the diﬃculty of describing them on classical computers —also makes it diﬃcult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is suﬃcient to allow a rich range of quantum eﬀects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems.

The algorithm depends on an integer p ≥ 1 and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is ﬁxed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of eﬃcient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a diﬀerent strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for ﬁxed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always ﬁnds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {Tensor network states are used to approximate ground states of local Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product states ({MPS}) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states ({PEPS}) in D{\textgreater}1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ({MERA}) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters. Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous {MPS} and {MERA} for D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law -- that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In addition, it has recently motivated the branching {MERA}, a generalization of the {MERA} capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D{\textgreater}1 dimensions.},

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as "the quantum variational eigensolver" was developed with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

The state of the molecular system at study is parametrized in a way to efficiently explore the sector of the molecular Fock space that contains the desired solution. To this end, we explore several trial wavefunctions to identify the most efficient parameterization of the molecular ground state. Taking advantage of known post-Hartree Fock quantum chemistry approaches and heuristic Hilbert space search quantum algorithms, we propose a new family of quantum circuits based on exchange-type gates that enable accurate calculations while keeping the gate count (i.e., the circuit depth) low. The particle-hole implementation of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ({UCC}) method within the Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach gives rise to an efficient quantum algorithm, named q-{UCC} , with important advantages compared to the straightforward 'translation' of the classical Coupled Cluster counterpart. In particular, we show how a single Trotter step can accurately and efficiently reproduce the ground state energies of simple molecular systems.},

Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to {BeH}2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05374},
	abstract = {A broad class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms known as “variational algorithms” have been proposed in the context of quantum simulation, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization as a means of potentially achieving a quantum speedup on a near-term quantum device for a problem of practical interest. Such algorithms use the quantum device only to prepare parameterized quantum states and make simple measurements. A classical controller uses the measurement results to perform an optimization of a classical function induced by a quantum observable which deﬁnes the problem. While most prior works have considered optimization strategies based on estimating the objective function and doing a derivative-free or ﬁnite-diﬀerence-based optimization, some recent proposals involve directly measuring observables corresponding to the gradient of the objective function. The measurement procedure needed requires coherence time barely longer than that needed to prepare a trial state. We prove that strategies based on such gradient measurements can admit substantially faster rates of convergence to the optimum in some contexts. We ﬁrst introduce a natural black-box setting for variational algorithms which we prove our results with respect to. We deﬁne a simple class of problems for which a variational algorithm based on low-depth gradient measurements and stochastic gradient descent converges to the optimum substantially faster than any possible strategy based on estimating the objective function itself, and show that stochastic gradient descent is essentially optimal for this problem. Importing known results from the stochastic optimization literature, we also derive rigorous upper bounds on the cost of variational optimization in a convex region when using gradient measurements in conjunction with certain stochastic gradient descent or stochastic mirror descent algorithms.},

It is similar in spirit to {MAX}-k-{SAT}, which is {NP}-complete for k ≥ 2. It was known that the problem is {QMA}-complete for any k ≥ 3. On the other hand, 1-local Hamiltonian is in P and hence not believed to be {QMA}-complete. The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is {QMA}-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our ﬁrst proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with 2-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

	abstract = {We use Nielsen's approach to quantify the circuit complexity in the one-dimensional Kitaev model. In equilibrium, we find that the circuit complexity of ground states exhibits a divergent derivative at the critical point, signaling the presence of a topological phase transition. Out of equilibrium, we study the complexity dynamics after a sudden quench, and find that the steady-state complexity exhibits nonanalytical behavior when quenched across critical points. We generalize our results to the long-range interacting case, and demonstrate that the circuit complexity correctly predicts the critical point between regions with different semi-integer topological numbers. Our results establish a connection between circuit complexity and quantum phase transitions both in and out of equilibrium, and can be easily generalized to topological phase transitions in higher dimensions. Our study opens a new avenue to using circuit complexity as a novel quantity to understand many-body systems.},

The task of an autoencoder is, given an input x, to map x to a lower dimensional point y such that x can likely be recovered from y. The structure of the underlying autoencoder network can be chosen to represent the data on a smaller dimension, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we introduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on quantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular data set of quantum states, where a classical compression algorithm cannot be employed. The parameters of the quantum autoencoder are trained using classical optimization algorithms. We show an example of a simple programmable circuit that can be trained as an efﬁcient autoencoder. We apply our model in the context of quantum simulation to compress ground states of the Hubbard model and molecular Hamiltonians.},

In practice, quantum computers must operate with noisy devices called ``gates'' that tend to destroy the fragile quantum states needed for computation. The goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing is to compute accurately even when gates have a high probability of error each time they are used. Here we give evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible with error probabilities above 3\% per gate, which is significantly higher than what was previously thought possible. However, the resources required for computing at such high error probabilities are excessive. Fortunately, they decrease rapidly with decreasing error probabilities. If we had quantum resources comparable to the considerable resources available in today's digital computers, we could implement non-trivial quantum computations at error probabilities as high as 1\% per gate.},

Second, we show that this class of classical algorithms generalizes a class previously considered in the literature, and also that a single step of the classical algorithm will outperform the single-step {QAOA} on all triangle-free {MAX}-{CUT} instances. In fact, for all but \$4\$ choices of degree, existing single-step classical algorithms already outperform the {QAOA} on these graphs, while for the remaining \$4\$ choices we show that the generalization here outperforms it. Finally, we consider the {QAOA} and provide strong evidence that, for any fixed number of steps, its performance on {MAX}-3-{LIN}-2 on bounded degree graphs cannot achieve the same scaling as can be done by a class of "global" classical algorithms. These results suggest that such local classical algorithms are likely to be at least as promising as the {QAOA} for approximate optimization.},

A quantum circuit driven by our framework learns a given task by tuning parameters implemented on it. The iterative optimization of the parameters allows us to circumvent the high-depth circuit. Theoretical investigation shows that a quantum circuit can approximate nonlinear functions, which is further confirmed by numerical simulations. Hybridizing a low-depth quantum circuit and a classical computer for machine learning, the proposed framework paves the way toward applications of near-term quantum devices for quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a timeevolving block-decimation ({TEBD}) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the {TEBD} algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the {TEBD} algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalizationgroup ({DMRG}) algorithms. The {TEBD} algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the {DMRG} community and it can be enhanced by using well-known {DMRG} techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing {DMRG} implementations to produce a remarkably eﬀective and versatile “adaptive time-dependent {DMRG}” variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

While low-depth quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigenvalue solver ({VQE}), have been used to determine ground state energies, methods for calculating excited states currently involve the implementation of high-depth controlled-unitaries or a large number of additional samples. Here we show how overlap estimation can be used to deflate eigenstates once they are found, enabling the calculation of excited state energies and their degeneracies. We propose an implementation that requires the same number of qubits as {VQE} and at most twice the circuit depth. Our method is robust to control errors, is compatible with error-mitigation strategies and can be implemented on near-term quantum computers.},

These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic "N6el ordered" states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as "local functions" of states of a special kind, so-called "purely generated states," which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range {VBS} interactions. We show that all these generalized {VBS} models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.},

	abstract = {Within the context of hybrid quantum-classical optimization, gradient descent based optimizers typically require the evaluation of expectation values with respect to the outcome of parameterized quantum circuits. In this work, we explore the significant consequences of the simple observation that the estimation of these quantities on quantum hardware is a form of stochastic gradient descent optimization. We formalize this notion, which allows us to show that in many relevant cases, including {VQE}, {QAOA} and certain quantum classifiers, estimating expectation values with \$k\$ measurement outcomes results in optimization algorithms whose convergence properties can be rigorously well understood, for any value of \$k\$. In fact, even using single measurement outcomes for the estimation of expectation values is sufficient. Moreover, in many settings the required gradients can be expressed as linear combinations of expectation values -- originating, e.g., from a sum over local terms of a Hamiltonian, a parameter shift rule, or a sum over data-set instances -- and we show that in these cases \$k\$-shot expectation value estimation can be combined with sampling over terms of the linear combination, to obtain "doubly stochastic" gradient descent optimizers. For all algorithms we prove convergence guarantees, providing a framework for the derivation of rigorous optimization results in the context of near-term quantum devices. Additionally, we explore numerically these methods on benchmark {VQE}, {QAOA} and quantum-enhanced machine learning tasks and show that treating the stochastic settings as hyper-parameters allows for state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer circuit executions and measurements.},

	abstract = {Local Hamiltonians with topological quantum order exhibit highly entangled ground states that cannot be prepared by shallow quantum circuits. Here, we show that this property may extend to all low-energy states in the presence of an on-site \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry. This proves a version of the No Low-Energy Trivial States ({NLTS}) conjecture for a family of local Hamiltonians with symmetry protected topological order. A surprising consequence of this result is that the Goemans-Williamson algorithm outperforms the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}) for certain instances of {MaxCut}, at any constant level. We argue that the locality and symmetry of {QAOA} severely limits its performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-local version of {QAOA}, and give numerical evidence that it significantly outperforms standard {QAOA} for frustrated Ising models on random 3-regular graphs.},

	abstract = {The Fermi-Hubbard model is of fundamental importance in condensed-matter physics, yet is extremely challenging to solve numerically. Finding the ground state of the Hubbard model using variational methods has been predicted to be one of the first applications of near-term quantum computers. Here we carry out a detailed analysis and optimisation of the complexity of variational quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of the Hubbard model, including costs associated with mapping to a real-world hardware platform. The depth complexities we find are substantially lower than previous work. We performed extensive numerical experiments for systems with up to 12 sites. The results suggest that the variational ans{\textbackslash}"atze we used -- an efficient variant of the Hamiltonian Variational ansatz and a novel generalisation thereof -- will be able to find the ground state of the Hubbard model with high fidelity in relatively low quantum circuit depth. Our experiments include the effect of realistic measurements and depolarising noise. If our numerical results on small lattice sizes are representative of the somewhat larger lattices accessible to near-term quantum hardware, they suggest that optimising over quantum circuits with a gate depth less than a thousand could be sufficient to solve instances of the Hubbard model beyond the capacity of classical exact diagonalisation.},

	abstract = {We study the hardness of learning unitary transformations by performing gradient descent on the time parameters of sequences of alternating operators. Such sequences are the basis for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and represent one of the simplest possible settings for investigating problems of controllability. In general, the loss function landscape of alternating operator sequences in \$U(d)\$ is highly non-convex, and standard gradient descent can fail to converge to the global minimum in such spaces. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that -- despite the highly non-convex nature of the control landscape -- when the alternating operator sequence contains \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$ or more parameters, gradient descent always converges to the target unitary. The rates of convergence provide evidence for a "computational phase transition." When the number of parameters is less than \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, gradient descent converges to a sub-optimal solution. When the number of parameters is greater than \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, gradient descent converges rapidly and exponentially to an optimal solution. At the computational critical point where the number of parameters in the alternating operator sequence equals \$d{\textasciicircum}2\$, the rate of convergence is polynomial with a critical exponent of approximately 1.25.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms ({VQAs}) optimize the parameters \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ of a quantum neural network \$V({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ to minimize a cost function \$C\$. While {VQAs} may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming \$V({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is a hardware-efficient ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining \$C\$ in terms of global observables leads to an exponentially vanishing gradient (i.e., a barren plateau) even when \$V({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is shallow. This implies that several {VQAs} in the literature must revise their proposed cost functions. On the other hand, our second result states that defining \$C\$ with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of \$V({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}log n)\$. Taken together, our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a particular {VQA} known as quantum autoencoders.},

We systematically analyze their performance on the {QAOA} ansatz for the Transverse Field Ising Model ({TFIM}) as well as on overparametrized circuits with the ability to break the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The {BFGS} algorithm is frequently unable to find a global minimum for systems beyond about 20 spins and {ADAM} easily gets trapped in local minima. On the other hand, {NatGrad} shows stable performance on all considered system sizes, albeit at a significantly higher cost per epoch. In sharp contrast to most classical gradient based learning, the performance of all optimizers is found to decrease upon seemingly benign overparametrization of the ansatz class, with {BFGS} and {ADAM} failing more often and more severely than {NatGrad}. Additional tests for the Heisenberg {XXZ} model corroborate the accuracy problems of {BFGS} in high dimensions, but they reveal some shortcomings of {NatGrad} as well. Our results suggest that great care needs to be taken in the choice of gradient based optimizers and the parametrization for {VQEs}.},

We consider approximation of unitary operations on subspaces as well as approximation of states and of density matrices by quantum circuits in several natural metrics. The ability of quantum circuits to probabilistically solve decision problem and guess checkable functions is discussed. We also address exact unitary representation by reducing the upper bound by a factor of n{\textasciicircum}2 and by formalizing the argument given by Barenco et al. [1995] for the lower bound. The overall conclusion is that almost all problems are hard to solve with quantum circuits.},

	abstract = {Compiling quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers (accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost on a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling ({QAQC}). In {QAQC}, we use the overlap between a target unitary

                U

              and a trainable unitary

                V

              as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More precisely, to ensure that {QAQC} scales well with problem size, our cost involves not only the global overlap


                  T

              but also the local overlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth quantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that our cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under reasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and gradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost. As a demonstration of {QAQC}, we compile various one-qubit gates on {IBM}'s and Rigetti's quantum computers into their respective native gate alphabets. Furthermore, we successfully simulate {QAQC} up to a problem size of 9 qubits, and these simulations highlight both the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of {QAQC}. Future applications of {QAQC} include algorithm depth compression, black-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.},

	abstract = {Parametrized quantum circuits initialized with random initial parameter values are characterized by barren plateaus where the gradient becomes exponentially small in the number of qubits. In this technical note we theoretically motivate and empirically validate an initialization strategy which can resolve the barren plateau problem for practical applications. The technique involves randomly selecting some of the initial parameter values, then choosing the remaining values so that the circuit is a sequence of shallow blocks that each evaluates to the identity. This initialization limits the effective depth of the circuits used to calculate the first parameter update so that they cannot be stuck in a barren plateau at the start of training. In turn, this makes some of the most compact ans{\textbackslash}"atze usable in practice, which was not possible before even for rather basic problems. We show empirically that variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum neural networks initialized using this strategy can be trained using a gradient based method.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm \${\textbackslash}mathcal A\$ such that \$A {\textbar}0{\textbackslash}rangle= {\textbackslash}sum\_\{x{\textbackslash}in X\} {\textbackslash}alpha\_x {\textbar}x{\textbackslash}rangle\$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of \$X\$, and let \$a\$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if \$A {\textbar}0{\textbackslash}rangle\$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running \$A\$, measuring the output, and using \${\textbackslash}chi\$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat \$1/a\$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good \$x\$ after an expected number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{a\}\$, assuming algorithm \$A\$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which \$A\$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of \$X\$ and we had a promise that a single \$x\$ existed such that \${\textbackslash}chi(x)=1\$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of \$a\$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of \$a\$ is known, we can find a good \$x\$ after a number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{a\}\$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of \$a\$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of \$x{\textbackslash}in X\$ such that \${\textbackslash}chi(x)=1\$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

In particular, we focus on the nature of the entangler blocks which provide the most efficient convergence to the system ground state inasmuch as they use the minimal number of gate operations, which is key for the implementation of this algorithm in {NISQ} computers. Using the concurrence measure, the amount of entanglement of the register qubits is monitored during the entire optimization process, illuminating its role in determining the efficiency of the convergence. Finally, we investigate the scaling of the {VQE} circuit depth as a function of the desired energy accuracy.

	abstract = {Recently, there has been much interest in the efficient preparation of complex quantum states using low-depth quantum circuits, such as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}). While it has been numerically shown that such algorithms prepare certain correlated states of quantum spins with surprising accuracy, a systematic way of quantifying the efficiency of {QAOA} in general classes of models has been lacking. Here, we propose that the success of {QAOA} in preparing ordered states is related to the interaction distance of the target state, which measures how close that state is to the manifold of all Gaussian states in an arbitrary basis of single-particle modes. We numerically verify this for the ground state of the quantum Ising model with arbitrary transverse and longitudinal field strengths, a canonical example of a non-integrable model. Our results suggest that the structure of the entanglement spectrum, as witnessed by the interaction distance, correlates with the success of {QAOA} state preparation. We conclude that {QAOA} typically finds a solution that perturbs around the closest free-fermion state.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14384},
	abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms ({VQAs}) may be a path to quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum ({NISQ}) computers. A natural question is whether the noise on {NISQ} devices places any fundamental limitations on the performance of {VQAs}. In this work, we rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy {VQAs}, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of layers \$L\$. This implies exponential decay in the number of qubits \$n\$ when \$L\$ scales as \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{poly\}(n)\$, for sufficiently large coefficients in the polynomial. These noise-induced barren plateaus ({NIBPs}) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for an abstract ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz ({QAOA}) and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. In the case of the {QAOA}, we implement numerical heuristics that confirm the {NIBP} phenomenon for a realistic hardware noise model.},

In order to ameliorate some of these challenges, we investigate a layerwise learning strategy for parametrized quantum circuits. The circuit depth is incrementally grown during optimization, and only subsets of parameters are updated in each training step. We show that when considering sampling noise, this strategy can help avoid the problem of barren plateaus of the error surface due to the low depth of circuits, low number of parameters trained in one step, and larger magnitude of gradients compared to training the full circuit. These properties make our algorithm preferable for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We demonstrate our approach on an image-classiﬁcation task on handwritten digits, and show that layerwise learning attains an 8\% lower generalization error on average in comparison to standard learning schemes for training quantum circuits of the same size. Additionally, the percentage of runs that reach lower test errors is up to 40\% larger compared to training the full circuit, which is susceptible to creeping onto a plateau during training.},

To execute this algorithm, the hardware eﬃcient ansatz is often used, thanks to its implementability and expressibility; however, this ansatz has a critical issue in its trainability in the sense that it generically suﬀers from the so-called gradient vanishing problem. This issue can be resolved by limiting the circuit to the class of shallow alternating layered ansatz. However, even though the high trainability of this ansatz is proved, it is still unclear whether it has rich expressibility in state generation. In this paper, with a proper deﬁnition of the expressibility found in the literature, we show that the shallow alternating layered ansatz has almost the same level of expressibility as that of hardware eﬃcient ansatz. Hence the expressibility and the trainability can coexist, giving a new designing method for quantum circuits in the intermediate-scale quantum computing era.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11011},
	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are a leading candidate for early applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. These algorithms depend on a classical optimization outer-loop that minimizes some function of a parameterized quantum circuit. In practice, finite sampling error and gate errors make this a stochastic optimization with unique challenges that must be addressed at the level of the optimizer. The sharp trade-off between precision and sampling time in conjunction with experimental constraints necessitates the development of new optimization strategies to minimize overall wall clock time in this setting. We introduce an optimization method and numerically compare its performance with common methods in use today. The method is a simple surrogate model-based algorithm designed to improve reuse of collected data. It does so by estimating the gradient using a least-squares quadratic fit of sampled function values within a moving trusted region. To make fair comparisons between optimization methods, we develop experimentally relevant cost models designed to balance efficiency in testing and accuracy with respect to cloud quantum computing systems. The results here underscore the need to both use relevant cost models and optimize hyperparameters of existing optimization methods for competitive performance. We compare tuned methods using cost models presented by superconducting devices accessed through cloud computing platforms. The method introduced here has several practical advantages in realistic experimental settings, and has been used successfully in a separately published experiment on Google's Sycamore device.},

Rigorous scaling results are urgently needed for specific {QNN} constructions to understand which, if any, will be trainable at a large scale. Here, we analyze the gradient scaling (and hence the trainability) for a recently proposed architecture that we called dissipative {QNNs} ({DQNNs}), where the input qubits of each layer are discarded at the layer's output. We find that {DQNNs} can exhibit barren plateaus, i.e., gradients that vanish exponentially in the number of qubits. Moreover, we provide quantitative bounds on the scaling of the gradient for {DQNNs} under different conditions, such as different cost functions and circuit depths, and show that trainability is not always guaranteed.},

	abstract = {This thesis discusses the young fields of quantum pseudo-randomness and quantum learning algorithms. We present techniques for derandomising algorithms to decrease randomness resource requirements and improve efficiency. One key object in doing this is a k-design, which is a distribution on the unitary group whose kth moments match those of the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We show that for a natural model of a random quantum circuit, the distribution of random circuits quickly converges to a 2-design. We then present an efficient unitary k-design construction for any k, provided the number of qubits n satisfies k = O(n/log n). In doing this, we provide an efficient construction of a quantum tensor product expander, which is a generalisation of a quantum expander which in turn generalises classical expanders. We then discuss applications of k-designs. We show that they can be used to improve the efficiency of many existing algorithms and protocols and also find new applications to derandomising large deviation bounds. In particular, we show that many large deviation bound results for Haar random unitaries carry over to k-designs for k = poly(n). In the second part of the thesis, we present some learning and testing algorithms for the Clifford group. We find an optimal algorithm for identifying an unknown Clifford operation. We also give an algorithm to test if an unknown operation is close to a Clifford or far from every Clifford.},

	abstract = {The Variational Quantum Eigensolver ({VQE}) is a method of choice to solve the electronic structure problem for molecules on near-term gate-based quantum computers. However, the circuit depth is expected to grow significantly with problem size. Increased depth can both degrade the accuracy of the results and reduce trainability. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reduce ansatz circuit depth. Our approach, called {PermVQE}, adds an additional optimization loop to {VQE} that permutes qubits in order to solve for the qubit Hamiltonian that minimizes long-range correlations in the ground state. The choice of permutations is based on mutual information, which is a measure of interaction between electrons in spin-orbitals. Encoding strongly interacting spin-orbitals into proximal qubits on a quantum chip naturally reduces the circuit depth needed to prepare the ground state. For representative molecular systems, {LiH}, H\$\_2\$, (H\$\_2\$)\$\_2\$, H\$\_4\$, and H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$, we demonstrate for linear qubit connectivity that placing entangled qubits in close proximity leads to shallower depth circuits required to reach a given eigenvalue-eigenvector accuracy. This approach can be extended to any qubit connectivity and can significantly reduce the depth required to reach a desired accuracy in {VQE}. Moreover, our approach can be applied to other variational quantum algorithms beyond {VQE}.},

We then consider certain quantum systems on these complexes. A future goal is to construct a family of Hamiltonians such that every low energy state has topological order as part of an attempt to prove the quantum {PCP} conjecture. This goal is approached by constructing a toric code Hamiltonian with the property that every low energy state without vertex defects has topological order, a property that would not hold for any local system in any lattice Zd or indeed on any 1-hyperﬁnite complex. Further, such {NH} complexes ﬁnd application in quantum coding theory. The hypergraph product codes1 of Tillich and Z´emor are generalized using {NH} complexes.},

	abstract = {We show that for any many-body quantum state there exists an unentangled quantum state such that most of the two-body reduced density matrices are close to those of the original state. This is a statement about the monogamy of entanglement, which cannot be shared without limit in the same way as classical correlation. Our main application is to Hamiltonians that are sums of two-body terms. For such Hamiltonians we show that there exist product states with energy that is close to the ground-state energy whenever the interaction graph of the Hamiltonian has high degree. This proves the validity of mean-ﬁeld theory and gives an explicitly bounded approximation error. If we allow states that are entangled within small clusters of systems but product across clusters then good approximations exist when the Hamiltonian satisﬁes one or more of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state where the blocks in the partition have sublinear entanglement. Previously this was known only in the case of small expansion or in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Our approximations allow an extensive error in energy, which is the scale considered by the quantum {PCP} (probabilistically checkable proof) and {NLTS} (no low-energy trivial-state) conjectures. Thus our results put restrictions on the possible Hamiltonians that could be used for a possible proof of the {qPCP} or {NLTS} conjectures. By contrast the classical {PCP} constructions are often based on constraint graphs with high degree. Likewise we show that the parallel repetition that is possible with classical constraint satisfaction problems cannot also be possible for quantum Hamiltonians, unless {qPCP} is false. The main technical tool behind our results is a collection of new classical and quantum de Finetti theorems which do not make any symmetry assumptions on the underlying states.},

Such simulations on quantum computers, promising a significantly greater accuracy and speed, are projected to exert a great impact on the way we can probe reality, predict the outcomes of chemical experiments, and even drive design of drugs, catalysts, and materials. In this work we review the current status of quantum hardware and algorithm theory and examine whether such popular claims about quantum advantage are really going to be transformative. We go over subtle complications of quantum chemical research that tend to be overlooked in discussions involving quantum computers. We estimate quantum computer resources that will be required for performing calculations on quantum computers with chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum computers for the molecules H\$\_2\$ for increasing basis set sizes, and Cr\$\_2\$ for a variety of complete active spaces ({CAS}) within the scope of the {CASCI} and {CASSCF} methods. The results obtained for the chromium dimer enable us to estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic correlation on a quantum computer should take less time than analogous computations on a classical computer. Using this result, we speculate on the types of chemical applications for which the use of quantum computers would be both beneficial and relevant to industrial applications in the short term.},
